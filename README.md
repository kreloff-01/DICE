DICE (Data Improved City Exploration)

Our project seeks to extend the existing Google Maps API using
data from data.cityofchicago.org,in ways that improve the lives
of everyday citizens' health and safety. These tools are meant
to assist people heading outside, whether it be biking or driving.

    Features
        - Google API now has the ability to select the route
        with the least potholes in it
        - Select the optimal biking route for exercise
        (highest cumulative elevation gain)
        - Select the easiest biking route for relaxed biking
        (lowest cumulative elevation gain)
